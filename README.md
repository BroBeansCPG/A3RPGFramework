## Previous repository

For those of you who wonder why there is little history/versions of each file and not a lot of commits - we were not able to make the previous repository public due to security concerns, revealing things like passwords and similar in the history/versions.

Nevertheless, here is a screendump from the previous repo of the contributors that worked with me at that time and how our timeline looks like.
